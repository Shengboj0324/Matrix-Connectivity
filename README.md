# Matrix Connectivity Investigation: Discovering Graph Connectivity Through Matrix Multiplication

## Abstract

This investigation explores how ordinary matrix multiplication reveals structural facts about network connectivity. Through empirical experiments and rigorous performance analysis, we demonstrate that matrix powers A^k count walks of length k between nodes, and that the Boolean union of these powers provides complete reachability information equivalent to graph traversal algorithms. The study compares matrix-based approaches with direct graph algorithms, revealing significant performance differences while confirming mathematical equivalence.

## 1. Introduction and Learning Objectives

The primary objective of this investigation is to empirically discover and mathematically articulate the relationship between matrix multiplication and graph connectivity. This work addresses three fundamental learning goals:

1. Build and manipulate graphs of varying sizes and structures to create a comprehensive test suite
2. Empirically discover what information matrix multiplication provides about connectivity through systematic experimentation
3. Compare the performance of matrix-based approaches versus direct graph algorithms for computing connectivity

The investigation follows a discovery-based methodology where mathematical insights emerge from computational experiments on carefully constructed graph collections.

## 2. Graph Collection and Data Structure (20 points)

### 2.1 Graph Suite Composition

The investigation employs a diverse collection of five graph types, ranging from 10 to 150 nodes:

- **Path Graph (10 nodes)**: Linear chain structure testing reachability in simple connected graphs
- **Cycle Graph (10 nodes)**: Circular structure demonstrating strong connectivity properties
- **Star Graph (21 nodes)**: Hub-and-spoke pattern illustrating centralized connectivity
- **Grid Graph (100 nodes)**: 10×10 lattice structure representing spatial connectivity patterns
- **Clustered Graph (150 nodes)**: Five clusters with bridge connections testing complex connectivity

### 2.2 Graph Representation Convention

All graphs follow consistent mathematical conventions:
- **Undirected**: All edges are bidirectional, ensuring symmetric adjacency matrices
- **Unweighted**: All edges have unit weight, represented as 1 in adjacency matrices
- **Simple**: No self-loops or multiple edges between node pairs
- **Connected Components**: Graphs may contain multiple connected components for analysis

### 2.3 Data Format Specification

Graphs are stored in JSON format with standardized structure:

```json
{
  "name": "graph_identifier",
  "description": "Graph type and properties",
  "nodes": [{"id": 0, "x": 100, "y": 200}],
  "edges": [{"from": 0, "to": 1}]
}
```

## 3. Interactive Editor and Visualization (20 points)

### 3.1 Editor Functionality

The web-based interactive editor provides comprehensive graph manipulation capabilities:

- **Node Operations**: Add, remove, and reposition nodes with real-time coordinate updates
- **Edge Operations**: Create and delete edges through intuitive click-based interaction
- **Import/Export**: JSON format compatibility with analysis algorithms
- **Sample Generation**: Built-in templates for standard graph types
- **Real-time Analysis**: Connectivity status and graph property computation

### 3.2 Technical Implementation

The editor utilizes HTML5 Canvas for rendering with JavaScript event handling for user interaction. The implementation supports multiple interaction modes (add node, add edge, delete, select/move) with visual feedback for current mode and selected elements.

### 3.3 Integration with Analysis Pipeline

The editor exports graphs in the same JSON format used by the analysis algorithms, ensuring seamless integration between graph creation and mathematical analysis. This design enables rapid prototyping and testing of graph structures for connectivity experiments.

## 4. Discovery Statement and Mathematical Evidence (25 points)

### 4.1 Core Discovery

**Discovery Statement**: When computing A^k (the k-th power of the adjacency matrix A), the entry (A^k)_{ij} equals the number of walks of length exactly k from node i to node j. The Boolean union of A^1, A^2, ..., A^{n-1} produces the reachability matrix, where entry R_{ij} = 1 if and only if node j is reachable from node i via some path.

### 4.2 Mathematical Foundation

The discovery follows from the fundamental property of matrix multiplication:
(A^k)_{ij} = Σ_ℓ (A^{k-1})_{iℓ} × A_{ℓj}

This recursively counts all k-step walks by extending (k-1)-step walks with one additional edge. The Boolean union captures reachability because any path of length ≤ n-1 suffices to establish connectivity in an n-node graph.

### 4.3 Empirical Evidence

**4-Node Path Example (0-1-2-3)**:
- A^1: Shows direct connections (adjacent nodes only)
- A^2: Shows 2-step walks (nodes separated by one intermediate)
- A^3: Shows 3-step walks (complete path traversals)
- Reachability Matrix: All entries = 1 (confirming full connectivity)

**10-Node Cycle Example**:
- Matrix powers reveal symmetric walk patterns due to circular structure
- Even powers show return paths to starting positions
- Odd powers show forward progression around the cycle
- Complete reachability confirms strong connectivity

### 4.4 Theoretical Justification

The mathematical correctness follows from the associative property of matrix multiplication and the interpretation of adjacency matrices as linear transformations on the space of node distributions. Each multiplication step extends walks by exactly one edge, and the Boolean union operation captures the existence of paths regardless of length.

## 5. Implementation Correctness (20 points)

### 5.1 Matrix Multiplication Implementation

The matrix multiplication algorithm employs the standard triple-nested loop approach without external linear algebra libraries:

```python
def matrix_multiply(A, B):
    C = [[0 for _ in range(cols_B)] for _ in range(rows_A)]
    for i in range(rows_A):
        for j in range(cols_B):
            for k in range(cols_A):
                C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]
    return C
```

This implementation has O(n³) complexity per multiplication and computes matrix powers through repeated multiplication.

### 5.2 Direct Graph Algorithm Implementation

The BFS-based connectivity algorithm computes all-pairs reachability through systematic graph traversal:

```python
def compute_reachability_matrix_bfs(adj_matrix):
    n = len(adj_matrix)
    reachability = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    for start in range(n):
        reachable_nodes = bfs_reachable(adj_matrix, start)
        for node in reachable_nodes:
            reachability[start][node] = 1
    return reachability
```

This approach has O(n²) complexity for dense graphs and O(n(n+m)) for sparse graphs.

### 5.3 Correctness Verification

All implementations undergo systematic verification:
- **Functional Testing**: Unit tests verify correct behavior on known inputs
- **Cross-Validation**: Matrix and BFS methods produce identical results on all test graphs
- **Edge Case Handling**: Proper behavior for empty graphs, single nodes, and disconnected components
